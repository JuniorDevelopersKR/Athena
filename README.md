## Athena
This is a Lecture sharing platform.  

## Motivation
When I took a lecture, i saw a student. The student was hard to hear the lecture. I decided to share contents of lecture with him. But, it was not enough to understand the contents of the lecture.

So I make a Lecture sharing platform. this project's name is 'Athena'. Athena is greek god of knowledge. this project's vision will be to grow into a platform that shares all the knowledge of the world.
